# Reaction Time Trainer

A mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for scientific reaction time testing, built with evidence-based protocols from volleyball sports science research.

## üöÄ Features

- **Scientific Testing Protocols**: Evidence-based reaction time measurement following volleyball research methodology
- **Multi-Modal Testing**: Visual and auditory reaction time tests with choice reaction support
- **Outlier Exclusion**: Automatic statistical outlier removal for accurate performance measurement
- **Performance Analytics**: Evidence-based performance ratings (Elite/Competitive/Recreational/Training)
- **PWA Ready**: Full Progressive Web App with offline capabilities and native install
- **Data Export**: CSV export and Web Share API integration
- **Local Storage**: Persistent data storage with personal best tracking
- **Warm-up Protocol**: Scientific 4-stage warm-up sequence for optimal performance

## üì± Mobile-First Design

Built specifically for smartphone-based testing with:
- Touch-optimized interface
- Haptic feedback support
- Safe area handling for notched devices
- Prevents accidental zoom and scrolling
- Dark theme optimized for reaction testing

## üî¨ Scientific Foundation

Based on research from:
- Volleyball reaction time studies (female setters avg 236ms visual, 200ms auditory)
- Sports science protocols for outlier exclusion
- Evidence-based performance thresholds
- 10-15 trial blocks for statistical reliability
