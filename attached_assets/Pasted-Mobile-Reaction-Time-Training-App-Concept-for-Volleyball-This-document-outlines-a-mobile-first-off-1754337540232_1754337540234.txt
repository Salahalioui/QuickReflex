Mobile Reaction-Time Training App Concept for Volleyball
This document outlines a mobile-first, offline-capable web app for scientific reaction-time testing and training in volleyball, tailored to Salah’s needs. The app will support both single-device tests and multi-device synchronized drills, implement validated protocols from sports science, and enable offline use (PWA) with local data sync. We recommend a React-based tech stack (e.g. Next.js or Vite), Tailwind CSS for UI, IndexedDB for local storage, and a Node.js + Socket.IO server for LAN synchronization. Supporting literature on reaction-time training in volleyball and related sports underpins the design (see References).
Application Modes: Single-Device & Multi-Device
Single-Device Reaction Tests: Controlled tests on one smartphone/tablet for scientific protocols (simple RT, choice RT, auditory vs. visual). The device displays randomized cues (screen flash, shapes or colors, optionally sounds) at unpredictable intervals (with a random delay, e.g. 1–3 s) to prevent anticipation
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Athletes respond by tapping the screen or pressing a virtual button; the app records timestamps to compute reaction time (stimulus to response). Protocol parameters (number of trials, rest between trials, warm-up, etc.) follow research best practices

Multi-Device Synchronized Drills: A coach controls a Node.js/Socket.IO server on the local Wi-Fi (no internet needed). Multiple athlete devices (smartphones/tablets) connect over LAN via WebSockets. In this mode, the app can issue spatial cues: for example, different devices flash or beep at random, prompting athletes at various court positions to react. This enables reactive agility and team drills. The system randomizes which device(s) cue and when, ensuring unpredictable stimuli. For instance, one device might light up or emit a sound (“go” signal) and the corresponding athlete must respond quickly (move, tap, or perform a direction-specific action). Figure below illustrates a reactive agility setup (devices at different locations with random LED cues):

Synchronization & Latency: The LAN server sends cue commands via Socket.IO, ensuring near-instantaneous triggering on all devices. Timestamps are logged locally, and the server can aggregate data in real time. No cloud or internet is required once the devices join the local network.
Testing & Training Protocols
Our app implements scientifically validated protocols for reaction-time assessment and training:
Randomized Stimulus Onset: Each trial begins with a warning (“Ready” prompt), then a random delay (e.g. 1–3 seconds) before the cue, to prevent anticipation
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This matches best practices in sport testing.
Trial Blocks: Standard blocks of 10–15 trials per session are used. For testing, we record multiple attempts (e.g. 5–15 trials) and average results. We exclude the fastest and slowest (outliers) before averaging, as done in research
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
Pre/Post Training: The app supports scheduled retesting (e.g. pre- and post- a training period of 4–6 weeks). Studies show significant RT improvements over 6-week programs (e.g., stroboscopic vision training led to faster reactive agility in young volleyball players
bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com
). We can track changes over time per athlete or team.
Warm-Up and Familiarization: Each testing session includes a warm-up protocol (e.g. 5–12 minutes of jogging and dynamic stretching, plus practice trials) as recommended in literature
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. For example, Sekulić et al. used a 12-minute general warm-up followed by specific RT drills
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Familiarization trials ensure athletes understand the task before official data collection
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
Rest Intervals: Adequate rest between trials/blocks is built in (e.g. 1–2 minutes) to prevent fatigue affecting results
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
Multimodal Stimuli: Supports both visual cues (screen flash, colored targets, animated shapes) and auditory cues (beeps) to train different RT pathways. Athletes can choose tests by modality (visual RT vs. auditory RT). Research indicates RT differs by modality, so both modes are valuable
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

. For example, one study found responses to auditory vs. tactile stimuli differ significantly

These features align with sports science protocols: short reaction times and quick movement are crucial for volleyball success

. We incorporate findings that tech-enhanced training (e.g. LED cue devices) boosts RT and quickness in volleyball

Mobile-First UI/UX Design
The interface is optimized for on-court use on smartphones and tablets:
Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, adaptive layout on any screen size. Large buttons and high-contrast graphics ensure visibility in bright gym conditions.
Simple Controls: A clear “Start Test” button, mode selection (e.g. simple RT, choice RT, auditory test), and athlete selection screen (name/team) guide flow. Visual cues are large shapes or flashes; auditory cues are loud beeps (with volume control).
Tap-based Response: Athletes respond by tapping anywhere on the screen (no need for precise targeting), which registers a timestamp. For choice tests, multiple on-screen buttons can represent different options (e.g. left/right).
Feedback: Immediately after each trial, the device shows the reaction time (in ms) and whether the response was correct. At session end, a summary screen shows average RT, best/worst trials, and simple charts (bar graph or histogram) for performance distribution.
Team Management: Coaches can create “teams” and add players. Each session can be tagged (e.g. date, drill type) and results are saved per athlete. This supports grouping and long-term tracking of individual progress.
Offline-First Architecture
To ensure reliable use in any gym environment, the app is a Progressive Web App (PWA):
Service Workers & Caching: All app assets (HTML/CSS/JS) and static data are cached on first load, so the app can launch offline. A service worker serves cached files and updates them when new versions are available.
Local Data Storage: Trial results are stored in IndexedDB on the device. This allows fast reads/writes without internet. When online (or on LAN in multi-device mode), data can optionally sync to a server or Firebase, but offline use is primary.
LAN WebSocket Server: A small Node.js/Socket.IO server runs on the coach’s laptop or a dedicated device in the gym. It broadcasts cues and timestamps over the local network. Because this is LAN-only, no internet is needed. (For development or remote coaching, the same app can connect to Firebase realtime DB, but this is optional.)
PWA Installation: Users can “install” the app to their home screen. On reloads, it behaves like a native app (no URL required). Updates occur seamlessly when online.
Data Handling and Reporting
The app rigorously records and analyzes data:
Timestamp Logging: Each cue and response event is timestamped (with millisecond precision). Reaction time = response time – cue time, computed per trial.
Data Export: Coaches can export data as CSV or JSON for research/analysis. The export includes timestamps, RT values, drill settings, athlete and session metadata. This supports publication and integration with other tools.
Analytics and Visualization: Built-in charts display progress. For example, after each session, the app shows a histogram of trial RTs and a line chart of average RT over multiple sessions. Trends over weeks are plotted to visualize improvement.
Group Reporting: Data can be aggregated by team. The coach dashboard shows each player’s recent average RT and improvement trajectory. It can highlight outliers and flag if performance regresses (for athlete monitoring).
Privacy & Access: All data stays local (and on the LAN server). No personal data is sent online unless explicitly exported.
Optional LLM Integration
An optional feature uses a text-based LLM (e.g. Google’s Gemini 2.5 via API) to generate insights from the data. For example:
After a training block, the coach can request an AI summary of each athlete’s performance. The LLM ingests the RT data and outputs human-readable feedback (e.g. “Alice’s reaction speed improved 8% over 4 weeks. She could focus on closing the gap in her auditory responses.”).
The LLM might suggest drills based on trends (e.g. “To boost Bob’s slow responses, try daily short saccade drills as per [Zwienko 2024] findings”).
This integration is text-only, running on a secure local or cloud endpoint, so it does not require embedding audio/image features. It is a convenience layer, not core to data collection.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React (Next.js or Vite) with Tailwind CSS for fast development and responsive UI. React PWA libraries (or custom Service Worker) enable offline mode.
Local Storage: IndexedDB (via a wrapper like Dexie.js) to store results, settings, and cached assets.
Backend (multi-device): Node.js server with Socket.IO for WebSocket communication on the LAN. The server only needs to handle real-time cue dispatch and basic data aggregation (it can be a lightweight Express app, or even a Docker container on the gym’s router).
Optional Sync: Firebase Firestore or Realtime DB can be used if remote access/sync is desired (e.g. for remote monitoring). However, the core app works fully offline.
Hosting: For development, the PWA can be hosted on Firebase Hosting or GitHub Pages. In practice, each device installs the PWA from the initial load. The Node.js server can be hosted on a cheap local device (e.g. a Raspberry Pi) that athletes connect to via Wi-Fi.
Build Tools: Vite or Next.js bundler; Git for version control; Jest/React Testing Library for unit tests. CI/CD pipelines can deploy the PWA to a hosting service when internet is available.
Sports Science Rationale
This design is grounded in sports science findings: Quick reaction times (RT) are critical in volleyball, where the ball often exceeds 100 km/h and every millisecond counts
