### **About Me**

**Dr. Salah**
*Ph.D. in Sport Sciences – Elite Sports Training (2025)*
*Researcher | Sports Technologist | Developer*

I am a sport science researcher from El Bayadh, Algeria, with a doctoral specialization in elite athletic training. My academic and field experience spans multiple disciplines, including volleyball, soccer, and youth athletic development.

This application was developed to bridge the gap between scientific research and real-world sports practice—particularly in under-resourced settings. It offers athletes and coaches an accessible, evidence-based platform for measuring and training reaction time using nothing more than standard smartphones and local connectivity.

My work focuses on merging sports science with digital technology through low-cost, scalable solutions. This includes the integration of modern web technologies and AI (such as large language models like Gemini 2.5) to enhance testing, analysis, and personalized training feedback.

Although inspired by practical needs in Algerian sport contexts, this tool is designed for multidisciplinary use in research, training, and performance optimization across various sports domains.
